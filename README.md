# Round-Robin-Algorithm
The Round Robin (RR) algorithm is a CPU scheduling technique used in operating systems. It assigns a fixed time slice (quantum) to each process in the ready queue, allowing each one to run for that duration in a circular order. If a process doesn't finish within its time slice, it's placed at the end of the queue, and the next process gets the CPU.
